# Resource Design

> Reference for the [api-design](../SKILL.md) skill.

## URL Structure

```
# Resources are nouns, plural, lowercase, kebab-case
GET    /api/v1/users
GET    /api/v1/users/:id
POST   /api/v1/users
PUT    /api/v1/users/:id
PATCH  /api/v1/users/:id
DELETE /api/v1/users/:id

# Sub-resources for relationships
GET    /api/v1/users/:id/orders
POST   /api/v1/users/:id/orders

# Actions that don't map to CRUD (use verbs sparingly)
POST   /api/v1/orders/:id/cancel
POST   /api/v1/auth/login
POST   /api/v1/auth/refresh
```

## Naming Rules

```
# GOOD
/api/v1/team-members          # kebab-case for multi-word resources
/api/v1/orders?status=active  # query params for filtering
/api/v1/users/123/orders      # nested resources for ownership

# BAD
/api/v1/getUsers              # verb in URL
/api/v1/user                  # singular (use plural)
/api/v1/team_members          # snake_case in URLs
/api/v1/users/123/getOrders   # verb in nested resource
```

## When to Nest Sub-Resources

Nest when the relationship is true ownership: orders belong to users, comments
belong to posts. **Do not** nest more than 2 levels deep — `/users/1/orders/2/items/3`
becomes brittle. Prefer flat IDs at depth 3+.
